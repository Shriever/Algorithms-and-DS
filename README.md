# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my personal implementations of fundamental **data structures and algorithms**.  
The goal of this project was to **solidify my understanding** by coding each structure and algorithm from scratch while following a Udemy DSA course.

## ðŸ“š Overview

Throughout this project, I explored and implemented:

### **Sorting Algorithms**
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### **Data Structures**
- Arrays & Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, basic traversal)
- Heaps (Min-Heap / Max-Heap)
- Hash Tables

### **Algorithms & Concepts**
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming (basic problems)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this repository was to:
1. **Practice core DSA concepts** through hands-on coding.
2. **Reinforce problem-solving skills** by implementing algorithms from scratch.
3. **Follow along with a structured Udemy course** to build a strong foundation for more advanced topics.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Writing algorithms from scratch **deepens conceptual understanding** beyond just using built-in libraries.
- Learning DSA systematically builds a foundation for **technical interviews** and **problem-solving** in real-world applications.
- Practicing recursion and dynamic programming helps **develop algorithmic thinking** for complex problems.
